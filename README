A web interface to configure Linux-based network appliances. It's been
developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux and its derivative for
embedded systems, Voyage Linux (http://linux.voyage.hk/). It should work on 
other distros too, altough untested right now. Fell free to contribute and 
test.

For any web page, you may change .html extension into .json or .yaml to
get machine-readable data. 

An .rb extension is also available for debugging purposes when in 
Sinatra 'development' environment.

Software requirements for "core" (check individual directories under modules/
for module-specific, additional requirements): 

* ruby 1.9 (preferably >=1.9.1)
* iproute2
* iptables (with proper kernel support)
* bridge-utils (brctl)
* pciutils (lspci command)
* dhcpcd
* dnsmasq >= 2.46 
  ## removed ISC-style leasefile format, which is assumed when no
  ## dhcp-range is provided -- and leads to troubles
* locales 
  ## and generate (UTF8) locales for languages/countries you want to support

Gems:

# gem source --add http://gemcutter.org

# gem install rubytree
# gem install sinatra
# gem install i18n_data
# gem install locale
# gem install thin 
# gem install r18n-core
# gem install r18n-sinatra

Optional add-ons:

You can get pretty-printed JSON output via JsonPrinter 
by Mark McGranaghan. To get it, change to the lib/ directory, then:

git clone git://github.com/techcrunch/json_printer.git

You can also take advantage of Ya2YAML by Akira FUNAI to get native 
UTF-8 YAML ouptut (i.e. no need to treat Unicode Strings as binary data
and encode them in base64). Change to lib/, then:

wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/51481/ya2yaml-0.29.tar.gz
tar xvzf ya2yaml-0.29.tar.gz

(This manual install will not be required when ya2yaml >= 0.29 becomes 
available as a gem. Check http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=2206 for updates).
