A web interface to configure Linux-based network appliances. It's been
developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux and one of its derivatives for
embedded systems, Voyage Linux (http://linux.voyage.hk/). It should work on 
other GNU/Linux distros too, altough untested right now. Fell free to 
contribute and test.

Default username and pasword: admin .

For any web page, you may change .html extension into .json or .yaml to
get machine-readable data. 

An .rb extension is also available for debugging purposes when in 'development'
environment.

Software requirements for "core" (check individual directories under modules/
for module-specific, additional requirements): 

* ruby 1.9 (preferably >=1.9.1)
* iproute2
* iptables (with proper kernel support)
* dhcpcd
* dnsmasq
* locales 
  ## and set the locale to something reasonable, with Unicode support
  ## i.e. "en_US.UTF-8" is ok, "C" or "POSIX" is not

Gems:

# gem source --add http://gemcutter.org

# gem install rubytree
# gem install sinatra
# gem install i18n_data
# gem install thin 
  ## (for some reasons I was compelled to explicitly 'require' thin, so a
  ## slight modification to the code is required to use one of the 
  ## other webservers supported by Sinatra and Rack). 

Optionally, you can get pretty-printed JSON output via JsonPrinter 
by Mark McGranaghan. To get it, change to the lib/ directory, then:

git clone git://github.com/techcrunch/json_printer.git
