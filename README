A web interface to configure Linux-based network appliances. It's been
developed and tested on Voyage GNU/Linux (htp//linux.voyage.hk/) but
one of its goals is to support many GNU/Linux distributions (contributors
and testers are always welcome ;-).

It's based on Sinatra, ERB, and a bunch of other gems. 

Optionally, you can get pretty-printed JSON output via JsonPrinter 
by Mark McGranaghan. To get it, change to the lib/ directory, then:

git clone git://github.com/techcrunch/json_printer.git

Some artworks from the GNOME project are included too, see 
public/icons/gnome for details and Copyright info.
