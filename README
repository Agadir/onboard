A web interface to configure Linux-based network appliances. It's been
developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux and its derivative for
embedded systems, Voyage Linux (http://linux.voyage.hk/). It should work on 
other distros too, altough untested right now. Feel free to contribute and 
test.

For any web page, you may change .html extension into .json or .yaml to
get machine-readable data. 

An .rb extension is also available for debugging purposes when in 
Sinatra 'development' environment.

Software requirements for "core" (check individual directories under modules/
for module-specific, additional requirements): 

* ruby 1.9.2 (yeah! use File.realpath, among other things)
* sudo
* iproute2
* iptables (with proper kernel support)
* bridge-utils (brctl)
* pciutils (lspci command)
* dhcpcd 
  * Also, resolvconf is recommended
* dnsmasq >= 2.64
  * removed ISC-style leasefile format, which is assumed when no
    dhcp-range is provided -- and leads to troubles
  * --host-record (bugfixed)
* locales 
  ## and generate (UTF8) locales for languages/countries you want to support
* ifrename (optional) 

Gems:

(some gems are written in C or C++ , so you need a reasonably complete 
C/C++ build environment; and, if you installed a pre-packaged ruby, you
will need header files from a package named ruby-dev or something alike)

gem install erubis rack rubytree sinatra i18n_data locale thin r18n-core sinatra-r18n escape facets hierarchical_menu uuid --no-ri --no-rdoc

Gem version specific requirements:

  * facets            >= 2.9.0
  * hierarchical_menu >= 0.1.4

Please read carefully doc/sysadm/example/etc/sysctl.conf and copy and/or append 
the configuration to the Linux machine /etc/sysctl.conf file.
