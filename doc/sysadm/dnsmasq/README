Providing DHCP an DNS services to the local network.

* Do not use BIND or other nameservers installed locally

* use dnsmasq for serving DHCP and forward DNS queries to external 
  nameservers (not to localhost) got via dhcp (yes, this appliance may be
  a dhcp client on some interface and dhcp server on other) or setup 
  manually

* at least on Debian systems you MUST install the 'resolvconf' package
  * for example, dhcpcd is wrapped and cannot update /etc/resolv.conf without
    calling resolvconf

* /etc/dnsmasq.conf must be empty (or not exist at all).
 * service will be restartet with --conf-dir=__a_custom_dir__ , but 
   /etc/dnsmasq.conf will be read anyway, so we need to avoid 
   conficts/duplicates
