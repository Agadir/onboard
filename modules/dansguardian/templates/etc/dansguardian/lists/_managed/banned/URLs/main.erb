#URLs in banned list
#Don't bother with the http:// or the www

#The bannedurllist is for blocking PART of a site
#The bannedsitelist is for blocking ALL of a site

#The 'grey' lists override the 'banned' lists.
#The 'exception' lists override the 'banned' lists also.
#The difference is that the 'exception' lists completely switch
#off *all* other filtering for the match.  'grey' lists only
#stop the URL filtering and allow the normal filtering to work.

#An example of grey list use is when in Blanket Block (whitelist)
#mode and you want to allow some sites but still filter as normal
#on their content

#Another example of grey list use is when you ban a site but want
#to allow part of it.

#To include additional files in this list use this example:
#.Include<<%= dg.root %>/anotherbannedurllist>

#You can have multiple .Includes.

#listcategory: "Banned URLs"

#List other URLs to block:

members.home.net/uporn

# The squidGuard advert domain/URL lists are now included by default.
# To work with advanced ad blocking & the logadblocks option, advert
# phrase/site/URL lists should have the string "ADs" in their listcategory.
.Include<<%= dg.root %>/lists/blacklists/ads/urls>

#squidGuard/urlblacklist blacklists collection.
