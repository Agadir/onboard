== System requirements

=== QEMU

QEMU with KVM support (and kernel and hardware accordingly).

You should grant rw access on /dev/kvm to the OnBoard user!

OnBoard user needs read/WRITE access even on DVD/CDROM ISO images, if
you want to eject/replace them at runtime: maybe a bug in QEMU Monitor...

Copy [this directory]/doc/sysadm/examples/etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel-nested.conf
into your host's /etc/modprobe.d/ to enable Nested VMX. More info at
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/virtual/kvm/nested-vmx.txt

Now, USB disk/pendrive support is enabled. If you want to *boot* from
such a device:

  * you need a recent qemu-kvm release (and related/included BIOSes): 
    * fine: qemu-kvm-1.2.0 compiled from source;
    * bad:  qemu-kvm-1.0   from Ubuntu package;
  * you must use the boot menu (press F12) and choose the USB device; 
  * you might have to *wait* a bit, after bootloader screen (for example
    with a Debian installer image).


=== Other programs

'tunctl': on Debian, it's provided by uml-utilities package (currently
it's not actually used: TAPs are created on demand by qemu-kvm itself,
but may be useful nonethless).


== OnBoard module dependencies:

jqueyFileTree


== Gem dependencies:

gem install uuid rmagick cronedit chronic_duration


== VNC/SPICE clients

To avoid mouse pointer mismatches, a client with capture/release is
strongly suggested, such as Vinagre on Unix or [see below] on Windows.

Alternetively, you can use SPICE, which is a more advanced protocol.
There are clients for Unix and Windows, with capture/release and which also 
support VNC:
