== System requirements

=== QEMU

QEMU with KVM support (and kernel and hardware accordingly).

You should grant rw access on /dev/kvm to the OnBoard user!

OnBoard user needs read/WRITE access even on DVD/CDROM ISO images,
if you want to change them at runtime: maybe a bug in QEMU Monitor...

=== Other programs

'tunctl': on Debian, it's provided by uml-utilities package 


== OnBoard module dependencies:

jqueyFileTree


== Gem dependencies:

gem install uuid rmagick


== VNC clients

To avoid mouse pointer mismatches, a client with capture/release is 
strongly suggested, such as Vinagre on Unix or [FIXME] on Windows.
