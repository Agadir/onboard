== System requirements

=== QEMU

QEMU with KVM support (and kernel and hardware accordingly).

You should grant rw access on /dev/kvm to the OnBoard user!

OnBoard user needs read/WRITE access even on DVD/CDROM ISO images,
if you want to change them at runtime: maybe a bug in QEMU Monitor...

Copy [this directory]/doc/sysadm/examples/etc/modprobe.d/kvm-intel-nested.conf 
into your host's /etc/modprobe.d/ to enable Nested VMX. More info at
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/virtual/kvm/nested-vmx.txt

=== Other programs

'tunctl': on Debian, it's provided by uml-utilities package 


== OnBoard module dependencies:

jqueyFileTree


== Gem dependencies:

gem install uuid rmagick cronedit chronic_duration


== VNC clients

To avoid mouse pointer mismatches, a client with capture/release is 
strongly suggested, such as Vinagre on Unix or [FIXME] on Windows.
