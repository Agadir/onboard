== System permissions

You should grant rw access on /dev/kvm to the OnBoard user!

OnBoard user needs read/WRITE access even on DVD/CDROM ISO images,
if you want to change them at runtime: maybe a bug in QEMU Monitor...

== OnBoard module dependencies:

jqueyFileTree

== Gem dependencies:

gem install uuid rmagick
