Compile coova-chilli[1] from source, DO NOT use debian/ directory
under source tree to create a Debian Wheezy package: as per our
tests it leds to issues with child processes.

Assumptions:

* one instance per network interface

* only configuration file is parsed, no command line options (except --conf)
