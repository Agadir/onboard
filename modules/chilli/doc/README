NOTE: using CoovaChilli [1] version <= 1.0.14 : newer versions spawns 
child processes and this OnBoard module is not (yet) capable to 
manage chilli process groups.

Other assumptions:

* one instance per network interface

* only configuration file is parsed, no command line options (except --conf)
